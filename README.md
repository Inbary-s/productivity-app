# SuratÄƒ: Productivity Application for the Modern Human

## Description of app and process of creating it

  * As a busy person trying to keep track of my personal and professional progress, I want to be able to track my goals and the tasks neccessary to achieve them. I also want to make sure I take time to recenter through meditation so that I am better prepared to reach my goals stress free.

The user is able to: 

  * Add goals and individiual tasks. User is able to remove tasks and goals, or mark them as complete which triggers the progress bar to fill. At 100% completion they are congratulated with a pop up.

  * Visualize goals and tasks via a calendar.

  * Use a timer to use the Pomodoro Technique to complete their tasks and breaks.

  * Take a momemnt for themselves to reset by listening to a relaxing soundtrack while breathing in time with an onscreen animation.

## Technologies Used

  * Database information

  * Passport Authentication

  * React Calendar 

  * GreenSock
  This set of plugins and tools allows for simple creation of animated objects. Modifying a div to display as a circle we were able to use TimelineMax and Power0
  to animate it as a breathing focus point on the page. TimelineMax allowed us to "yoyo" the div in and out at the desired rate. Power0 assists with the timing for each step of the movement.

  * React-Sound
  The React-Sound NPM contains an awesome Sound component that allows you to easily build the ability to play and control sound clips in your code.
