# SuratÄƒ: Productivity Application for the Modern Human

## Description of app and process of creating it

  * As a busy person trying to keep track of my personal and professional progress, I want to be able to track my goals and the tasks neccessary to achieve them. I also want to make sure I take time to recenter through meditation so that I am better prepared to reach my goals stress free.

The user is able to: 

  * Add goals and individiual tasks. User is able to remove tasks and goals, or mark them as complete which triggers the progress bar to fill. At 100% completion they are congratulated with a pop up.

  * Visualize goals and tasks via a calendar.

  * Use a timer to use the Pomodoro Technique to complete their tasks and breaks.

  * Take a momemnt for themselves to reset by listening to a relaxing soundtrack while breathing in time with an onscreen animation.
